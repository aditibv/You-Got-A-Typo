You Got a Typo: Detecting Typo-Squatting domains using Machine Learning Approach

Typo-squatting is an unethical practice in the realm of cybersecurity that capitalizes on human oversight and inexpensive domain registrations to 
divert genuine traffic from top-level domains. This method is commonly employed for phishing attacks, redirecting users to competitors' sites, or 
disseminating inappropriate or harmful content, posing an ongoing concern for businesses. Instances have been documented where threat actors 
utilize typo-squatted domains for the distribution of malicious software. Despite multiple awareness initiatives designed to educate individuals on 
recognizing potentially harmful URLs, the number of victims continues to rise. Given that human error represents the inherent vulnerability 
exploited by these malicious actors, it is imperative to close this gap by enhancing user awareness, thereby averting potential phishing threats. 
Typo-squatting calls In this report we have implemented a browser extension with capability to detect a potentially typo squatting domain 
leveraging a machine learning model which allows the user to verify the legitimacy of the URL the user has types in the browser.
